# INTERMEDIATE TASK-2:Online Code Editor
Creating an online code editor running in browsers offers complete IDE functionalities, and it's a valuable skill-building project. It can potentially lead to a startup as a free interviewing platform. This project involves two main components: Backend API: This server-side component takes code and language as input and provides the output after executing the code on the server. Frontend Editor: On the frontend, you can choose a language, edit and modify the code. After editing, you make a post request to the backend API and display the output on the website.
